# Accordion Component Analysis

## Atomic Design Level

The requested component is an **organism**. It is a complex component that consists of smaller components (atoms and molecules). The atoms could be the header and the content sections, and the molecule could be the combination of the header and its corresponding content section.

## Component Complexity and Composition

The accordion component is relatively complex. It consists of multiple sections, each with a clickable header and expandable/collapsible content. It also needs to manage the state of each section (expanded or collapsed).

## Required Props and State

The component will need the following props:

- `sections`: An array of objects, each containing a `header` (string) and `content` (ReactNode).

The component will need to maintain a state for each section to track whether it is expanded or collapsed.

## UI/UX Patterns

The accordion is a common UI pattern used to display a large amount of content in a compact space. It should be designed with accessibility in mind, including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes.

## Tailwind Styling Approach

Tailwind can be used to style the accordion component. The styling should be responsive and accessible. The headers could have a hover effect to indicate interactivity. The content sections could have a transition effect when expanding/collapsing.
